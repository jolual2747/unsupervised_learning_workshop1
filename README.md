# Unsupervised Learning Workshop1

Here we are going to explore how some unsupervised learning methods have been built and also to implement them!

In addition, we are going to create an app (HTTP server) that receives records and will return the class of the image.

## Steps to replicate the repository:

```sh
git clone <ssh code>
pip install pipenv
pipenv shell
pipenv install
```

### notebooks:

#### **- workshop_development.ipynb**

Here you can find basics of linear algebra, images handling, singular value decomposition on images, PCA and t-SNE implementation

### lib:

Here is located a utils.py file where are written the class built from scratch for unsupervised learning
